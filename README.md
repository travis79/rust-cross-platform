# Rust-Cross-Platform

This is my playground for testing what is and isn't possible with a cross platform library written in Rust.

Note that the iOS and Android projects use a relative path structure to grab the library.

This is the example I was following along with, for more info on setup and such: [Building and Deploying a Rust library on iOS](https://mozilla.github.io/firefox-browser-architecture/experiments/2017-09-06-rust-on-ios.html)
